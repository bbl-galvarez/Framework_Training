You were required go implement the following:

- Integrate the apiKey and **JSON Web Token** in the headers for the requests and are considered secured routes in **NODE JS** application
- Integrate the apkiKey only in the header for unsecured routes 
   

In order to execute it, you should have the ATM Web Service from  **AtmWebServiceMongo** from the TypeScript folder already running on port 3000. then either clone bootcamp repo or git pull to update if you already cloned it, then run `ng serve --open` to run the application and open your browser.

**NOTE**: Keep note that this Angular Cient Application still needs the unsecured ATM WEB SERVICE MONGO edition from the TypeScript project.
