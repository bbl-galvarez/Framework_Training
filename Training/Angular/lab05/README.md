# Solution for Lab05

You were required to build an Angular Client Applications that would implement the NG Router module and access the new refactor ATM Web Service MongoDB enabled.
 

In order to execute it, you should have the ATM Web Service from  **AtmWebServiceMongo** from the TypeScript folder already running on port 3000. then either clone bootcamp repo or git pull to update if you already cloned it, then run `ng serve --open` to run the application and open your browser.
